## 💡 How It Works

- Tasks are entered via an input and assigned to one of four categories.
- Each category appears in a fixed-size scrollable box within a 2x2 grid layout.
- Tasks are saved in the browser’s `localStorage`, so they remain even after refreshing or closing the tab.
- The **Contact Us** form appears at the bottom of the page and includes basic form validation.
